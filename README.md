# Gravitational_Wave
Collection of Mathematica notebooks worked out for a variety of papers and books.  Utilizes the General Relativity Tensors package from the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit package.  They have *NOT* been edited fully and as such probably contain quite a few errors.  But it's not a bad place to start.
